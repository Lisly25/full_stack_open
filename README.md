# ABOUT

This repository contains my exercise solutions to University of Helsinki's [full stack open course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

In practice, this meant creating a lot of different, simple websites (or sometimes just a frontend or a backend).

Working through this material helped me learn about **JavaScript** both in the context of **React** and **NodeJS**. I have also gotten acquainted with non-relational databases via using **MongoDB**.

It was also my introduction to the test libraries **supertest**, **Playwright** and **Vitest**.

Last but not least, this course also had me deploy an app for the first time - the phonebook app from part 3 is hosted on Render, and can be found [here](https://full-stack-phonebook-d1bn.onrender.com/). (Beware! Aesthetics were not a concern at this point in the course, only functionality.)

Although not strictly a part of the course, I have also deployed the blog list app from part 7 (with some extra features added). The website can be seen [here](https://full-stack-blog-app-uclw.onrender.com/), while its source code is in [this repository](https://github.com/Lisly25/full_stack_blog_app)
